SYNOPSIS : 

Examining murder from an insider?s perspective, Matt Murphy?a former senior deputy district attorney and current ABC News Legal Analyst?discusses cases from his career, how they strained his personal life, and how he found peace seeking justice for victims and their families. Part taxonomy of murder, part prosecutor?s handbook, and part personal memoir, The Book of Murder goes through a dozen cases and his recollections of his twenty-six years in the Orange County DA?s office (seventeen in the Homicide Unit). Refreshingly honest about the toll such work takes on one?s private life, Murphy weaves his personal narrative throughout his casework in a way that humanizes the people entrusted with the duty of seeking justice on behalf of the public. As he does so, he lays bare the decision-making a prosecutor goes through in building a case to ensure justice is met while telling captivating tale after captivating tale of the world?s worst crime.
